# FLOOPY-GAME-
This a game project developed by using python . for this game project here we use pygame library 


PLAYER, BACKGROUND, PIPE: File paths for the player's sprite, background, and pipes.
Functions:

welcomeScreen(): Displays the welcome screen with the game title and prompts the user to start the game by pressing the space or up arrow key.

mainGame(): Implements the main game loop. It handles user input, updates the game state, and blits (draws) the game sprites on the screen.

isCollide(): Checks for collisions between the player and pipes or the ground.

getRandomPipe(): Generates random positions for two pipes (upper and lower) that will appear on the screen.

Initialization:

Initializes Pygame, sets the window caption, and initializes the game clock.
Loading Game Assets:

Loads various game assets such as numbers, messages, base, pipes, and sounds into the GAME_SPRITES and GAME_SOUNDS dictionaries.
Game Loop:

The game runs in an infinite loop, alternating between the welcome screen and the main game loop.
Event Handling:

Pygame events are used to handle user input, such as quitting the game or making the bird flap when the space or up arrow key is pressed.
Game Logic:

The main game loop updates the player's position, checks for collisions, and manages the appearance and movement of pipes.
Score Handling:

The player scores points when passing through pipes, and the score is displayed on the screen.
Rendering:

Sprites and text are blitted onto the game screen, and the display is updated at a specified frame rate.
Sound Effects:

Various sound effects are played during specific events in the game, such as hitting a pipe or scoring a point.
In summary, this code creates a simple Flappy Bird game where the player controls a bird to navigate through pipes, avoiding collisions and earning points for successful passes.
